# Mastering Markdown
**The Definition of Markdown:**

*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

*Markdown*is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
*Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.it is a better way to write **HTML** without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.

- In Markdown we use symbols like # or * ...etc.
- The extension of Markdown is: .md / .markdown
- Markdown uses in most places around GitHub:Gists,Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- we use symbols not tags
- it is not WYSIWYG
