# Mastering Markdown
**The Difintion of Markdown:**

*Markdown* is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. *Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

- In Markdown we use symbols like # or * ...etc.
- The extension of Markdown is: .md / .markdown
- use Markdown most places around GitHub:Gists,Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- use symbols not tags
- it is not WYSIWYG
