# Git
## *What is Git?


**Git**: is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
It is a version control system (VCS).

1. ### snapshot:
 it saves any changes you made and make it like *a screen shots*.

2. ### Local Operations:
Git depends on local operations because it contains most necessary information.

3. ### Tracking Changes:
Git allows you to track file versions,to show a changes history.

4. ### Loss of Data:
Git protects your data from being lost,it makes it extremely difficult for irreversible damage to files.

5. ### States:
Files in Git can reside in three main states: _*committed, modified and staged*_

## *Commands:

There is a *lot of Commands* that we can use in Git, for example:
* cd = (change directory)
* pwd =(print working directory)
*ls =(list me the list)
* ls-li=(list all)
* clear =(clear every thing)
* cd.. =(get back to previous)
* mk dir = (creat another directory) ...etc

## *The components of The local Git repository :
**-There are 3 components:**
1.Working Directory: The actual files reside here.

2.Index: The area used for staging

3.Head: Points to the most recent commit.

### *Seeing Your Remotes:

* **git remote command** :is one piece of the broader system which is responsible for syncing changes. Records registered through the git remote command are used in conjunction with the git fetch , git push , and git pull commands. by running this command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

 We write the command like this in the terminal:  **git remote -v**

*when i applied it in my replit, it seemed like that:*


~/reading-notesmd$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/naziha1986/reading-notes.md (fetch)
origin  

https://github.com/naziha1986/reading-notes.md (push)

~/reading-notesmd$
