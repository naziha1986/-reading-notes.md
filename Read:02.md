* cd = (change directory). it lets me any open directory.
* pwd =(print working directory).it is told me where am i.
*ls =(list me the the directories/foldersfrom inside current Directory that are not hidden). 
* ls-li=(list all files even hidden one)
* clear =(clear every thing in the terminal)
* cd.. =(get back to previous directory)
* mk dir = (creat another directory) ...etc
