# Git
## What is Git?


**Git**: is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

There is a *lot of Commands* that we can use in Git.*for example:*

* **git remote command** :is one piece of the broader system which is responsible for syncing changes. Records registered through the git remote command are used in conjunction with the git fetch , git push , and git pull commands. by running this command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

 We write the command like this in the terminal:  **git remote -v**

when i applied it in my replit, it seemed like that:


~/reading-notesmd$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/naziha1986/reading-notes.md (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/naziha1986/reading-notes.md (push)
~/reading-notesmd$
