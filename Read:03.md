# What is HTML?
HTML:*(Hyper text markup language)*we use it to structure our web pages & add content and information to it.

* in HTML we use tags <>, it will not appear in the result 
* it is _NOT_ **WYSIWYG**.

## Anatomy of an HTML element:
![HTML!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png)


1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element  wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. 

2. The closing tag: same as begining but it also includes a forward slash before the element name. 
3. The content: the content  is just text. 
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.Elements can also have attributes>

An attribute should always have the following:

* A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
* The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
* The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
## *types of Elements:
1. Nesting elements: it is putting elements inside other elements
2. Empty elements:any element without content(there is no closing tag),i.e: <img>

## *Semantics:
Semantics give meaning to a part or apiece of code.such as:"what effect does running here? or "what he purpose /goal does HTML elements have?"
>it is not what does it looks like
