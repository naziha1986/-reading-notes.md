## a growth mindset 
### Types of mindest:

 * growth mindset
 * fixed mindset
  
  *So what the difference betwwn them?*

**growth mindest**
it is a concept that makes you beleive that you are more *successful,productive and be proud of your self. it tells about the ability that you have to be developed through perseverance ,effort and learning more and more*.

 on the other hand, **fixed mindest**: intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

As you can see from the image above, there is alot of differences between the two concepts. by understanding both of them, we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset and pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful.

*Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset:*
 1. Challenges
 2.  Obstacles
 3.  Effort
 4.  Criticism
 5.  Success of others

**a growth mindest is acool thing.**
