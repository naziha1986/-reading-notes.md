## a growth mindset 
### Types of mindest:

 * growth mindset
 * fixed mindset
  
  #### *So what the difference between them?*

**growth mindest**
it is a concept that makes you beleive that you are more *successful,productive and be proud of your self. it tells about the ability that you have to be developed through perseverance ,effort and learning more and more*.

 on the other hand, **fixed mindest**: intelligence and talent are seen as *fixed traits*, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

As you can see from the image above, there is alot of differences between the two concepts. by understanding both of them, we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset and pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful.

## Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset:*
 1. Challenges
 2.  Obstacles
 3.  Effort
 4.  Criticism
 5.  Success of others 
 
 I will give **an example** to explain how can any one Persevering, gumpting traps, and maintaining a growth mindset.
 When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to search on google on a particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. if i stuck there , i will be afixed mindest.but I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward.
 when i meet Obstacles, my solution is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of me, walk away, and return when iam feeling more inspired. Now, granted, this isn’t often a viable option for projects at work, but just recognizing what’s happening (I’m avoiding and losing focus) helps me make peace with it, and usually un-traps just enough of my gumption to do one more thing on the project. 
 on the mornings when I get up and ride( walk),my body feels better, my spirit is stronger. I’m proud of myself, and that goes a long, long way.
 I also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how I’ve done. As I mentioned at the beginning, I often judge my days based on my mood at the end. My worst days are when I haven’t managed to get things together, I’ve procrastinated and wasted time, and I find myself with very little to look back on positively.
 i cannot forget rhe role of My team who includes the smartest people I’ve ever worked with.Some open and frank conversations with my fellow  during peer reviews, one-on-ones, and even in casual hallway interactions helped me in this shift of mindset. Because that’s another amazing thing about the way our company works.
 > Finally,a growth mindest is acooooooool.
